tinyRL is a tiny rogue-like written in C. 

## Playing
You will find yourself converted into a magenta `@` in a black enviroment surrounded by evil red `m`.  
But there's hope! Run to the `â–ˆ` and escape! But watch out, the `m` will chase you and five of them together have the power to kill you.

Control the `@` using `hjkl` or the arrow keys. If you get bored of this game (you won't, trust me), you can exit with `ESC` or `q`.

## Building
Should compile on most unixes, use a terminal emulator with UTF-8 support.

	git clone https://github.com/lukasepple/tinyrl.git
	cd tinyrl
	make
	./bin/tinyrl # have fun!
