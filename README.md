tiny rogue-like written in C. Its also a try to rewrite robot-rogue in C because my Object structure is totally broken.

## Playing
You will find yourself converted into a magenta `@` in a black enviroment surrounded by evil red `m`.  
But there's hope! Run to the `>` and escape! But watch out, the `m` will chase you and five of them together have the power to kill you.

## Building
`make` it.
